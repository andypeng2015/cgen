# Overview

cgen is a compiler backend.

Inspired by the [QBE](https://c9x.me/compile/) project.

# Setup

- To build and install the project, run `make` (these can be done individually with `make build` and `make install`, respectively).
- To uninstall the project, run `make uninstall`.
- To clean the build artifacts, run `make clean`.
- To run the unit tests, run `make test`.
- For generating documentation, run `make doc`.

The generated documentation (in HTML format) should be located in `./src/_build/default/_doc/_html/index.html`, which can be opened in your browser of choice.
