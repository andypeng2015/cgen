   Aside from the typical elements (i.e. our hash-consing of e-nodes
   and our union-find for canonicalization), we also have various
   tables that are keeping track of the relationship between an ID
   and its position (label) in the CFG representation.

   This gets a bit more complex when we want to perform optimizations
   related to code motion (e.g. LICM, CSE, hoisting, sinking), so that's
   what all the extra hash tables are for.

   See the [Egraph_sched], [Extractor_core], and [Extractor_cfg] modules
   for examples of how this information gets used.
